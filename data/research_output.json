        "title": "The most distant $γ$-ray flare to date: a multiwavelength campaign on the $z = 4.715$ blazar GB6 B1428+4217",
        "abstract": "In November 2023, the Fermi Large Area Telescope detected a $\\gamma$-ray\nflare from the high-redshift blazar GB6 B1428+4217 ($z=4.715$). We initiated a\nmulti-wavelength follow-up campaign involving Swift, NuSTAR, the Sierra Nevada\nand Perkins Observatories, and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. This\nsource, also known as 5BZQ J1430+4204, has shown an anomalous soft X-ray\nspectrum in previous observations, including possible ionized absorption\nfeatures or signatures of bulk Comptonization of thermal electrons, which are\nalso detected during the flaring episode. Simultaneous optical data revealed a\npolarization fraction of ${\\sim}8$\\% in the R band, confirming that synchrotron\nemission dominated over thermal emission from the accretion disk. The hard\nX-ray flux was enhanced during the flare. Modeling of the broadband spectral\nenergy distribution suggests that the high-energy component is dominated by\nCompton scattering by external seed photons from the accretion disk. The origin\nof the flare is consistent with the injection of a hard-spectrum electron\npopulation in the emission region. With a $\\gamma$-ray luminosity among the top\n5% of flaring events, GB6 B1428+4217 exemplifies a prototypical MeV blazar. Its\nCompton-dominated SED and extreme luminosity are in line with expectations from\nthe blazar sequence. High-redshift flares like this are critical for\nunderstanding jet physics in the early Universe and may improve detection\nprospects with future missions such as COSI.",

        "title": "HairCUP: Hair Compositional Universal Prior for 3D Gaussian Avatars",
        "abstract": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.",

        "title": "Tracers of the ionization fraction in dense and translucent molecular gas: II. Using mm observations to constrain ionization fraction across Orion B",
        "abstract": "The ionization fraction ($f_\\mathrm{e}=n_\\mathrm{e}/n_\\mathrm{H}$) is a\ncrucial parameter of interstellar gas, yet estimating it requires deep\nknowledge of molecular gas chemistry and observations of specific lines, such\nas those from isotopologs like HCO$^+$ and N$_2$H$^+$, which are detectable\nonly in dense cores. Previous challenges in constraining $f_\\mathrm{e}$ over\nlarge areas stemmed from the limitations of observational tracers and chemical\nmodels. Recent models have identified molecular line ratios that can trace\n$f_\\mathrm{e}$ in different environments within molecular clouds. In this\nstudy, we analyze various molecular lines in the 3-4 mm range to derive the\nionization fraction across the Orion B giant molecular cloud. We focus on dense\nand translucent gas, exploring variations with gas density ($n$) and the\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field ($G_0$). Our findings show that the\nionization fraction ranges from $10^{-5.5}$ to $10^{-4}$ in translucent gas and\n$10^{-8}$ to $10^{-6}$ in dense gas. Notably, $f_\\mathrm{e}$ is sensitive to\n$G_0$ in dense, UV-illuminated regions, decreasing with increasing volume\ndensity ($f_\\mathrm{e} \\propto n^{-0.227}$ for dense and $f_\\mathrm{e} \\propto\nn^{-0.3}$ for translucent gas) and increasing with $G_0$. In translucent gas,\ndiffering line ratios yield consistent fe values, indicating the importance of\nelectron excitation of HCN and HNC. For dense gas, we recommend using the\nCN(1-0)/N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) ratio for upper limits on fe and\nC$^{18}$O(1-0)/HCO$^+$(1-0) for lower limits. In translucent environments,\nCCH(1-0)/HNC(1-0) effectively traces $f_\\mathrm{e}$. The higher fe values in\ntranslucent gas align with the C$^+$/CI/CO transition, while values in dense\ngas are adequate for coupling with the magnetic field.",
