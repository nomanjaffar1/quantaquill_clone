# Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive overview of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing [1]. A new definition of neurosymbolic inference is introduced, integrating logical and belief functions to enable formal reasoning about propositional logic formulas. A simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system is described, combining learning from data and knowledge with logical reasoning to address challenges of data efficiency, fairness, and safety [2]. A literature survey of neurosymbolic reinforcement learning is conducted, categorizing works into three taxonomies and analyzing research opportunities and challenges. Novel models, including relational neurosymbolic Markov models and end-to-end differentiable sequential models, are introduced, providing strong guarantees and interpretability [3]. A complexity map of probabilistic reasoning is developed, helping practitioners determine the scalability of neurosymbolic techniques. A language for neurosymbolic programming, Scallop, is introduced, enabling users to write and train neurosymbolic applications efficiently. The promise of assurance of differentiable neurosymbolic reasoning paradigms is evaluated, highlighting opportunities and trade-offs. Finally, the potential of neurosymbolic AI in software engineering automation, cyber security, and model-grounded symbolic artificial intelligence systems is explored, demonstrating its feasibility and promising applications.
