# Abstract
This paper presents a comprehensive overview of neurosymbolic AI, a rapidly emerging field that combines the strengths of logical and neural representations to enable principled integration of reasoning and learning in deep networks [1]. We propose a formal definition of neurosymbolic AI as the computation of an integral over a product of a logical and a belief function [2]. We also introduce a neurosymbolic AI system that can represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula, addressing challenges in data efficiency, fairness, and safety of Large Language Models [3]. Furthermore, we conduct a literature survey of neurosymbolic reinforcement learning, categorizing works into three taxonomies and analyzing the RL components of each research work to identify research opportunities and challenges. Additionally, we introduce relational neurosymbolic Markov models, a new class of end-to-end differentiable sequential models that integrate and provably satisfy relational logical constraints [4]. Our contributions include a complexity map for probabilistic reasoning problems, a language for neurosymbolic programming, and a framework for assurance of end-to-end fully differentiable neurosymbolic systems. We also explore the potential of neurosymbolic AI for defending against cyber attacks and reimagine software engineering automation via a neurosymbolic paradigm. [5]
