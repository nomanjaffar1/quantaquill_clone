        "title": "Studying Protoplanets and Protoplanetary Disks with the Habitable Worlds Observatory",
        "abstract": "Since the discovery of the first exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, the\nconfirmation of nearly 6000 exoplanets to date - and their diversity - has\nrevolutionized our knowledge of planetary systems in the past three decades.\nNevertheless, the majority of these planets are around mature stars\n(${\\gtrsim}1$ Gyr), where the planet birth environments have already\ndissipated. Indeed, we have only confirmed 2 forming planets (i.e.,\nprotoplanets; ${\\lesssim}10$ Myr) residing in one single system. In comparison,\nwe have imaged over 200 protoplanetary disks in the past decade, with many of\nthem hosting substructures such as spirals and gaps which suggest the existence\nof protoplanets. To understand the early stages of planet formation, the\nHabitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - with its high-contrast imaging and\nintegral field spectroscopy capabilities - presents a unique opportunity to\nexplore the demographics of the natal stages of planet formation and their\nbirth environments. We propose to image protoplanets within substructured\nprotoplanetary disks using HWO via direct imaging, and characterize them (i.e.,\nprotoplanets, protoplanetary disks, circumplanetary disks) using integral field\nspectroscopy and spectropolarimetry. This effort will dramatically extend\ncurrent population of protoplanets, probing and characterizing over 200\nprotoplanets. By expanding the number of protoplanets by two orders of\nmagnitude, these observations will test and refine planet formation theory and\nplanet-disk interaction theory, and further motivate planet migration studies\ntogether with existing mature planets. The results will offer critical insight\ninto planetary system formation and evolution, and help understand the origin\nof our own Solar System.",

        "title": "Beneath the Surface: >85% of z>5.9 QSOs in Massive Host Galaxies are UV-Faint",
        "abstract": "We use [CII] observations of a large QSO sample to segregate sources by host\ngalaxy mass, aiming to identify those in the most massive hosts. [CII]\nluminosity, a known tracer of molecular gas, is taken as a proxy for host mass\nand used to rank 190 QSOs at z>5.9, spanning a 6-mag UV luminosity range\n(-22<Muv<-28). Particularly valuable are ALMA data from a cycle-10 CISTERN\nprogram, providing [CII] coverage for 46 UV-faint (M_{UV,AB}>-24.5) and 25\nespecially UV-faint (Muv>-23.5) QSOs, improving statistics by 5x and 6x,\nrespectively. Taking massive host galaxies to be those where L[CII]>1.8x10^9\nLsol (median L[CII] of UV-bright QSOs), we identify 61 QSOs, including 13 which\nare UV-faint and 7 especially UV-faint. Using these selections and recent QSO\nluminosity functions (LFs), we present the first characterization of UV\nluminosity distribution for QSOs in massive host galaxies and quantify [CII]\nLFs for both UV-bright and UV-faint QSOs. While ~3% of massive-host QSOs are\nUV-bright (Muv<-26), >~85% are UV-faint (Muv>-24.5). This wide dispersion in UV\nluminosities reflects variations in dust obscuration, accretion efficiency, and\nblack hole mass. Though spectroscopy is needed for definitive conclusions,\nblack hole mass appears to be the dominant factor driving variations in the UV\nluminosity, based on 34 [CII]-luminous (L[CII]>1.8x10^9 Lsol) QSOs distributed\nacross a ~3-mag baseline in UV luminosity and with measured MBH. At Muv~-23,\nthe median extrapolated log10 (MBH/Msol) is 8.1+/-0.4, consistent with the\nlocal relation. SMBHs in UV-bright QSOs thus appear to be ~15(-9)(+25)x more\nmassive than typical for massive host galaxies at z~6.",

        "title": "How to Design and Train Your Implicit Neural Representation for Video Compression",
        "abstract": "Implicit neural representation (INR) methods for video compression have\nrecently achieved visual quality and compression ratios that are competitive\nwith traditional pipelines. However, due to the need for per-sample network\ntraining, the encoding speeds of these methods are too slow for practical\nadoption. We develop a library to allow us to disentangle and review the\ncomponents of methods from the NeRV family, reframing their performance in\nterms of not only size-quality trade-offs, but also impacts on training time.\nWe uncover principles for effective video INR design and propose a\nstate-of-the-art configuration of these components, Rabbit NeRV (RNeRV). When\nall methods are given equal training time (equivalent to 300 NeRV epochs) for 7\ndifferent UVG videos at 1080p, RNeRV achieves +1.27% PSNR on average compared\nto the best-performing alternative for each video in our NeRV library. We then\ntackle the encoding speed issue head-on by investigating the viability of\nhyper-networks, which predict INR weights from video inputs, to disentangle\ntraining from encoding to allow for real-time encoding. We propose masking the\nweights of the predicted INR during training to allow for variable, higher\nquality compression, resulting in 1.7% improvements to both PSNR and MS-SSIM at\n0.037 bpp on the UCF-101 dataset, and we increase hyper-network parameters by\n0.4% for 2.5%/2.7% improvements to PSNR/MS-SSIM with equal bpp and similar\nspeeds.
