# Methodology
**Methodology**

This study employs a multi-agent framework to integrate neurosymbolic AI with scientific reasoning and automated writing. The framework consists of three primary components:

1. **Neurosymbolic Reasoning Module**: This module combines logical and neural representations to enable formal reasoning about propositional logic formulas. It leverages a formal definition of neurosymbolic AI, which computes an integral over a product of a logical and a belief function.
2. **Knowledge Graph Integration**: The module integrates a knowledge graph, which represents domain-specific knowledge and relationships. This integration enables the system to draw upon a vast repository of knowledge to inform its reasoning and writing processes.
3. **Multi-Agent Framework**: The framework consists of multiple agents, each responsible for a specific task. These agents communicate with each other to facilitate a collaborative approach to scientific reasoning and automated writing.

The study utilizes several tools and datasets, including:

* **Scallop**: A language that combines deep learning and logical reasoning, enabling users to write and train neurosymbolic applications efficiently.
* **Relational Neurosymbolic Markov Models (NeSy-MMs)**: A new class of end-to-end differentiable sequential models that integrate and provably satisfy relational logical constraints.
* **Large Code Models**: Pre-trained language models that have been fine-tuned for software engineering tasks.
* **Cybersecurity datasets**: Datasets used to evaluate the effectiveness of neurosymbolic AI in defending against cyber attacks.

The is as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: Relevant datasets are collected and preprocessed for use in the study.
2. **Model Development**: Neurosymbolic AI models are developed using the Scallop language and Relational Neurosymbolic Markov Models.
3. **Knowledge Graph Construction**: A knowledge graph is constructed to represent domain-specific knowledge and relationships.
4. **Multi-Agent Framework Implementation**: The multi-agent framework is implemented, with each agent responsible for a specific task.
5. **Evaluation**: The neurosymbolic AI system is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, runtime, and scalability.
6. **Cybersecurity Evaluation**: The system is evaluated in a cybersecurity context, using datasets and metrics relevant to the field.

The study's demonstrate the potential of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing, as well as its application in cybersecurity. The findings highlight the importance of integrating logical and neural representations to enable formal reasoning and improve the accuracy and reliability of AI-driven systems.
