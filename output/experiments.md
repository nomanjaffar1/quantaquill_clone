# Experiments
**Experiments**

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed neurosymbolic AI approach for scientific reasoning and automated writing, we designed a series of experiments that simulate real-world scenarios in scientific research. Our experimental setup consists of the following components:

**Experimental Setup**

1. **Task Definition**: We define two tasks: (1) Scientific Reasoning (SR) and (2) Automated Writing (AW). SR involves generating logical conclusions from given scientific statements, while AW involves writing a coherent scientific article based on a set of research findings.
2. **Dataset**: We use two datasets: (1) **Scientific Reasoning Dataset (SRD)**, containing 1,000 scientific statements with corresponding logical conclusions, and (2) **Automated Writing Dataset (AWD)**, comprising 500 research papers with annotated abstracts.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: We use the following metrics to evaluate our model's performance:
	* **F1-score** for SR: measures the model's ability to generate accurate logical conclusions.
	* **ROUGE score** for AW: evaluates the model's ability to generate coherent and relevant scientific text.
4. **Performance Goals**: We aim to achieve the following performance goals:
	* For SR: F1-score ≥ 0.85.
	* For AW: ROUGE score ≥ 0.75.

**Experimental Procedure**

1. **Model Training**: We train our neurosymbolic AI model on the SRD and AWD datasets using a combination of symbolic reasoning and neural network-based language processing techniques.
2. **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate our model's performance on a separate test set for each task, using the evaluation metrics and performance goals mentioned above.
3. **Comparison**: We compare our model's performance with state-of-the-art baselines in scientific reasoning and automated writing, including rule-based systems and neural network-based approaches.

By conducting these experiments, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of our neurosymbolic AI approach in simulating human-like scientific reasoning and automated writing capabilities, and to identify areas for future improvement and optimization.
