# Introduction
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to mimic the behavior of biological neurons and offer improved power efficiency, computation efficiency, and processing latency. Inspired by the workings of the human brain, SNNs have been applied to a wide range of tasks, including image classification, object detection, and knowledge representation. However, the development of SNNs is still in its early stages, and several challenges need to be addressed to fully realize their potential.

One of the primary challenges in SNN research is the need for efficient and accurate simulation and training methods. Traditional neural networks rely on continuous-valued signals, whereas SNNs operate on discrete spikes, which can be challenging to simulate and optimize. Additionally, SNNs often require large amounts of data and computational resources, which can be a significant limitation in many applications.

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various techniques, including the use of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), lateral inhibition, and simulation expansion. These approaches have shown promising in improving the performance and efficiency of SNNs. However, t

This paper aims to contribute to the development of SNNs by investigating their application to biological neural simulation. We will explore the use of SNNs to model and simulate the behavior of biological neurons, with a focus on the effects of various parameters on learning and the potential for reducing power usage [1]. Our research will build on recent advances in SNN research, including the development of novel simulation and training methods, and will provide new insights into the behavior and potential of SNNs.

In this paper, we will present a comprehensive review of recent developments in SNN research, including the use of STDP, lateral inhibition, and simulation expansion. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of SNN research and identify areas for future research. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of SNN research and to identify new directions for future research.

By exploring the application of SNNs to biological neural simulation, we hope to contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior and potential of SNNs and to identify new opportunities for their use in a wide range of applications.
