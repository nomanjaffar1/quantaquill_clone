        "summary": "Here is a 2-line summary of the abstract:\n\nNeurosymbolic AI aims to combine learning and reasoning by integrating logical and neural representations, but lacks a formal definition. The authors introduce a new definition that defines neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a logical and a belief function.",

These models can solve problems beyond the current state-of-the-art in neurosymbolic AI, provide strong guarantees, and are more interpretable, with the ability to adapt constraints at test time to out-of-distribution scenarios.",
