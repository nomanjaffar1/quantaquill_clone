# Methodology
**Methodology**

This study employs a multi-agent framework to simulate the behavior of spiking neural networks (SNNs) inspired by biological neural networks. The framework consists of multiple agents, each representing a neuron or a group of neurons, interacting with each other through spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and lateral inhibition. The agents are implemented using a combination of continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics, allowing for the simulation of complex neural networks with varying levels of abstraction.

**Knowledge Graph Integration**

To facilitate the integration of knowledge graphs with SNNs, we utilize a graph-based representation of the neural network, where nodes represent neurons and edges represent the connections between them. This allows us to leverage the strengths of both SNNs and knowledge graphs, enabling the representation of complex relationships and patterns in the data.

**Tools and Datasets Used**

The simulations were conducted using a custom-built SNN simulator, which is based on the TensorFlow framework. The simulator allows for the implementation of various neural network architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The datasets used in this study include the MNIST and N-MNIST datasets for image classification, as well as the R-STDP dataset for spike timing-dependent plasticity.

**Experimental Setup**

The were conducted using a combination of simulation and hardware-based implementations. The simulation-based were performed using the custom-built SNN simulator, while the hardware-based were conducted using a dedicated SNN accelerator. The experimental setup consisted of a multi-agent framework, with each agent representing a neuron or a group of neurons. The agents were connected through spike timing-dependent plasticity and lateral inhibition, allowing for the simulation of complex neural networks with varying levels of abstraction.

**Evaluation Metrics**

The performance of the SNNs was evaluated using a combination of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The metrics were calculated using the output of the SNNs, which were compared to the ground truth labels. The evaluation was conducted using a combination of simulation-based and hardware-based experiments, allowing for the comparison of the performance of the SNNs in different environments.

**Comparison to State-of-the-Art**

The performance of the SNNs was compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field of neural networks, including traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) and other types of SNNs. The comparison was conducted using a combination of simulation-based and hardware-based experiments, allowing for the evaluation of the performance of the SNNs in different environments.

**Conclusion**

In this study, we presented a multi-agent framework for simulating the behavior of spiking neural networks inspired by biological neural networks. The framework was used to simulate the behavior of SNNs with varying levels of abstraction, and the were compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field of neural networks. The study demonstrates the potential of SNNs for biological neural simulation and highlights the importance of integrating knowledge graphs with SNNs for complex pattern recognition and reasoning tasks.
