# ✅ **QuantaQuill – AI-Powered Scientific Paper Generator**

QuantaQuill is an **AI-driven system that automates the creation of structured scientific research papers**. It combines **neural language models** with **symbolic reasoning** to generate academic content that is coherent, logically validated, and well-cited.

---

## **✨ Key Features**

✔ Automated **literature review** from trusted sources
✔ Generation of all major sections:

* Abstract
* Introduction
* Methodology
* Experiments
* Results
* Conclusion
  ✔ **IEEE-style citations** and reference list
  ✔ Knowledge Graph-based **logical validation**
  ✔ **Export to PDF** in one click

## **🔍 Why QuantaQuill?**

Traditional paper writing is **time-consuming and manual**. QuantaQuill simplifies the process by leveraging:

* **Multi-Agent Architecture** for research, writing, and validation
* **Neurosymbolic AI** for structured and explainable outputs
* **Automation** without compromising academic integrity

---

## **🚀 How It Works**

1. **Enter your research topic**
2. (Optional) Add **Methodology** and **Experiments** details
3. The system:

   * Fetches and summarizes related literature
   * Writes structured sections
   * Adds citations and validates claims
4. **Download your paper in PDF format**

## **⚡ Quick Start**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantaquill.git
cd quantaquill

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run the application:**

```bash
# Start the FastAPI backend
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Start the Streamlit frontend
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```

**Access the interface:**
➡ [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## **📌 Example Output**

* Abstract
* Introduction
* Methodology
* Experiments
* Results
* Conclusion
* References (IEEE format)
