# QuantaQuill – AI-Driven Scientific Paper Generation

QuantaQuill is an advanced AI system designed to **automate the process of research paper generation**. It leverages a neurosymbolic multi-agent framework to ensure the final document is **coherent, well-structured, and properly cited**.

### ✅ Key Capabilities
- Automated literature review and summarization
- Structured generation of academic sections (Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Experiments, Results, Conclusion)
- Intelligent citation management with IEEE-style references
- Knowledge graph-based validation for logical consistency
- One-click export to PDF

### ✅ How It Works
1. **Input a research topic** (and optional methodology or experiment details).
2. The system performs literature retrieval and section generation.
3. Citations and references are automatically added and validated.
4. Download a polished research paper in PDF format.

### ✅ Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantaquill.git
cd quantaquill
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Run the app:

```bash
# Start backend
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload

# Start frontend
streamlit run frontend/app.py
```
