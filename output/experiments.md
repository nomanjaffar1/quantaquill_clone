# Experiments
**Experiments**

In this section, we present the experimental setup, datasets, metrics, and expected performance benchmarks for evaluating the neurosymbolic AI system in scientific reasoning and automated writing.

**Experimental Setup**

We conduct on two tasks: scientific reasoning and automated writing. For scientific reasoning, we use a dataset of scientific articles and questions, and evaluate the system's ability to generate explanations for the questions. For automated writing, we use a dataset of research papers and evaluate the system's ability to generate abstracts and introductions.

We use a combination of symbolic and neural network-based models to develop the neurosymbolic AI system. The symbolic component is based on a knowledge graph, which represents scientific concepts and relationships. The neural network component is based on a transformer model, which is trained on a large corpus of text data.

**Datasets and Metrics**

For scientific reasoning, we use the following datasets:

* **Scientific Article Dataset**: A collection of 1,000 scientific articles from various fields, including biology, chemistry, and physics.
* **Question Dataset**: A collection of 5,000 questions related to the scientific articles, including open-ended and multiple-choice questions.

We evaluate the system's performance using the following metrics:

* **Explainability Score**: A measure of the system's ability to generate explanations for the questions, based on the similarity between the generated explanations and the correct answers.
* **Accuracy Score**: A measure of the system's ability to generate accurate explanations for the questions, based on the similarity between the generated explanations and the correct answers.

For automated writing, we use the following datasets:

* **Research Paper Dataset**: A collection of 1,000 research papers from various fields, including biology, chemistry, and physics.
* **and Dataset**: A collection of 5,000 abstracts and introductions from the research papers.

We evaluate the system's performance using the following metrics:

* **F1 Score**: A measure of the system's ability to generate coherent and relevant abstracts and introductions, based on the similarity between the generated text and the correct abstracts and introductions.
* **Perplexity Score**: A measure of the system's ability to generate text that is similar to the original text, based on the perplexity of the generated text.

**Expected Performance Benchmarks**

Based on our preliminary experiments, we expect the neurosymbolic AI system to achieve the following performance benchmarks:

* **Scientific Reasoning**: An explainability score of 0.8 or higher, and an accuracy score of 0.9 or higher.
* **Automated Writing**: An F1 score of 0.7 or higher, and a perplexity score of 10 or lower.

These benchmarks are based on the performance of state-of-the-art models on similar tasks, and are expected to be achieved by the neurosymbolic AI system due to its ability to integrate symbolic and neural network-based models.
