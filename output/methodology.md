# Methodology
**Methodology**

This study employs a multi-agent framework to investigate the application of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing. The framework consists of four agents: Research, Writing, Citation, and Knowledge Graph.

**Research Agent**

The Research Agent is responsible for gathering and processing relevant literature on neurosymbolic AI, including its definition, reasoning, and applications. This agent utilizes a systematic search strategy to identify relevant papers, articles, and books, and employs a citation analysis tool to map the relationships between papers.

**Writing Agent**

The Writing Agent is responsible for generating the scientific paper. This agent uses a neurosymbolic AI system to write the paper, combining logical and neural representations to generate coherent and well-structured text.

**Citation Agent**

The Citation Agent is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of citations in the paper. This agent uses a citation management tool to format citations according to the chosen citation style and to detect any errors or inconsistencies.

**Knowledge Graph Agent**

The Knowledge Graph Agent is responsible for creating a knowledge graph that represents the relationships between concepts and entities in the paper. This agent uses a graph database to store the knowledge graph and to enable querying and visualization of the relationships between concepts.

**Tools and Architecture**

The study employs the following tools and architecture:

* **Neurosymbolic AI System**: A simple energy-based neurosymbolic AI system that combines learning from data and knowledge with logical reasoning.
* **Citation Management Tool**: A tool that formats citations according to the chosen citation style and detects any errors or inconsistencies.
* **Graph Database**: A database that stores the knowledge graph and enables querying and visualization of the relationships between concepts.
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools**: Tools that enable the Writing Agent to generate coherent and well-structured text.
* **Systematic Search Strategy**: A strategy that identifies relevant papers, articles, and books and maps the relationships between papers.

**Methodology**

The study follows a systematic to investigate the application of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing. The consists of the following steps:

1. **Literature Review**: The Research Agent conducts a systematic search of the literature on neurosymbolic AI, including its definition, reasoning, and applications.
2. **Neurosymbolic AI System Development**: The Writing Agent develops a neurosymbolic AI system that combines learning from data and knowledge with logical reasoning.
3. **Citation Analysis**: The Citation Agent analyzes the citations in the paper to ensure accuracy and completeness.
4. **Knowledge Graph Creation**: The Knowledge Graph Agent creates a knowledge graph that represents the relationships between concepts and entities in the paper.
5. **Writing**: The Writing Agent uses the neurosymbolic AI system to generate the scientific paper.
6. **Evaluation**: The study evaluates the quality and accuracy of the generated paper using a set of evaluation metrics.

By employing a multi-agent framework and a systematic methodology, this study aims to investigate the potential of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing, and to demonstrate its feasibility and effectiveness in generating high-quality scientific papers.
