# Introduction
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and symbolic reasoning has long been a topic of interest in the field of AI research [1]. Neurosymbolic AI, in particular, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential to combine the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic systems [2]. However, despite its promise, neurosymbolic AI still lacks a formal definition, and its applications in scientific reasoning and automated writing remain largely unexplored.

In this paper, we aim to address this gap by introducing a new definition of neurosymbolic inference and exploring its applications in scientific reasoning and automated writing [3]. We define neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a logical and a belief function, which allows for the integration of logical and neural representations. This definition provides a formal foundation for neurosymbolic AI and enables the development of novel algorithms and systems that can leverage the strengths of both neural networks and symbolic systems.

Our work builds upon recent advances in neurosymbolic AI, including the development of energy-based neurosymbolic AI systems that can represent and reason formally about any propositional logic formula, and the of relational neurosymbolic Markov models that can solve problems beyond the current state-of-the-art in neurosymbolic AI [4]. We also draw inspiration from the field of neurosymbolic reinforcement learning and planning, which has shown promise in integrating neural and symbolic approaches to achieve transparency and explainability.

In this paper, we explore the potential of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing, and demonstrate its feasibility through a series of and case studies [5]. We also identify challenges and limitations of neurosymbolic AI and propose future research directions to address these challenges [6]. Our contributions include a new definition of neurosymbolic inference, a novel algorithm for neurosymbolic reasoning, and a series of and case studies that demonstrate the potential of neurosymbolic AI in scientific reasoning and automated writing.

Overall, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of neurosymbolic AI and its applications in scientific reasoning and automated writing, and to inspire future research in this exciting and rapidly developing field. [7]
